                        Football in its current form arose in England in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.  The sport was at first entertainment for the British working class. The game was soon expanded by British people that traveled to other parts of the world. Football clubs have existed since the 15th century, but they were unrecognized and without official status. Federation International Football Association <a href="https://www.fifa.com/" class="history-link">(FIFA)</a> was founded in 1904. This game is slowly gaining in popularity but can be no match yet to the original game of football.

                        Goalkeeper is positioned in the penalty area to protect the goal. Their main duty is to stop the opposition from scoring goals by catching, palming, punching or kicking the ball from on target attacking shots. Goalkeeper is the only player allowed to handle the ball which is restricted to their penalty area.

                        Goalkeepers wear a different coloured kit compared to their teammates and also wears gloves to provide more grip on the ball and to protect their hand. Some goalkeepers even wear a headgaurd to protect from blows.

                        Goalkeeper, unlike other roles is the only irreplaceable role in football, meaning if a goalkeeper gets injured, he must be replaced by a substitute goalkeeper or if he gets sent off, a player in the outfield must take on the goalkeeper duties.

Already established as the most prestigious club tournament in football, Champions League has become even more popular with the introduction of a mini-league group stage system.  The Champions League trophy can be kept permanently by a club that win the tournament five times or three times in a row (since the rule changed in 2008 it is only a replica). It is today almost as adored as the FIFA World Cup Trophy.
